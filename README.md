# SideQuestr
Durhack 2024 Project

This Application uses Swift and an apple maps API to generate sidequests for you to go on for an IOS app. Each sidequest involves visiting a place of interest in a local area, such as in Durham visiting a cathedral or doing the Mary's mile. By completing the sidequests you'll gain experience (the harder the sidequest, the more XP gained) and level up or earn achievements. However, the aim of this app is to encourage an increase in physical exercise by turning it into a game. As an added bonus also encourages people to visit and support local charitites and business.
